# 💸 Expense Tracker (React)

This is a basic **Expense Tracker App** built using **React**. It allows users to:

- Add new expenses
- View expenses in a table
- Search/filter expenses by name or description
- Delete individual expenses

This project was created as a **Phase 2 Code Challenge** to demonstrate understanding of React basics — including state, props, components, and event handling.
